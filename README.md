Ensure Node.js is installed:
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install it from Node.js official website.

Navigate to your project directory:
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing your package.json file.

Install dependencies:
Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies listed in your package.json:

Code
npm install
Run the project:
Since there is no specific start script defined in your package.json, you can create a start script or run the main file directly if you have one.
To create a start script, add the following to your package.json under "scripts":

JSON
"scripts": {
  "start": "node child.js",
  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
}
Then, you can run the project using:

Code
npm start
Alternatively, if you have a main file (e.g., child.js), you can run it directly using:

Code
node child.js
